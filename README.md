#Shape Web
##Project Goal
Trying to make a dynamic website for simulating a shopping experience, where the users will shop for unique shapes in the website.

##Features
###Front End
Will work like an online store where the user can browse and shop for shapes.

###Back end
Here the user can see how their data are being stored, and the algorithms being used in order to learn the user interests. They will be able to get a peek into the back end of the website.
